/**
 * Abstract from IETF Specification
 * (http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/uuid-guid/draft-leach-uuids-guids-01.txt):
 * <p>
 * <i>This specification defines the format of UUIDs (Universally Unique
 * IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier). A UUID is 128
 * bits long, and if generated according to the one of the mechanisms in this
 * document, is either guaranteed to be different from all other UUIDs/GUIDs
 * generated until 3400 A.D. or extremely likely to be different (depending on
 * the mechanism chosen). UUIDs were originally used in the Network Computing
 * System (NCS) [1] and later in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF)
 * Distributed Computing Environment [2].
 * <p>
 * This specification is derived from the latter specification with the kind
 * permission of the OSF.

     * that could arise when the clock is set backwards in time or if the node
     * ID changes.
     * <p>
     * If the clock is set backwards, or even might have been set backwards
     * (e.g., while the system was powered off), and the GUID generator can not
     * be sure that no GUIDs were generated with timestamps larger than the
     * value to which the clock was set, then the clock sequence has to be
     * changed. If the previous value of the clock sequence is known, it can be
     * just incremented; otherwise it should be set to a random or high-quality
     * pseudo random value.
     * <p>
     * Similarly, if the node ID changes (e.g. because a network card has been
     * moved between machines), setting the clock sequence to a random number
     * minimizes the probability of a duplicate due to slight differences in the
     * clock settings of the machines. (If the value of clock sequence
     * associated with the changed node ID were known, then the clock sequence
     * could just be incremented, but that is unlikely.)
     * <p>
     * The clock sequence MUST be originally (i.e., once in the lifetime of a
     * system) initialized to a random number to minimize the correlation across
     * systems. This provides maximum protection against node identifiers that
     * may move or switch from system to system rapidly. The initial value MUST
     * NOT be correlated to the node identifier.
     * <p>
     * For GUID version 3, it is a 14 bit value constructed from a name.
     * <p>
     * For GUID version 4, it is a randomly or pseudo-randomly generated 14 bit

     * This call originally would use JNI to return the IEEE 802 addrsss from
     * the system. Because we do not want to support JNI on all the platforms we

     * is describe in the internet draft.

     * <p>
     * 4. Node IDs when no IEEE 802 network card is available
     * <p>
     * If a system wants to generate UUIDs but has no IEE 802 compliant network
     * card or other source of IEEE 802 addresses, then this section describes
     * how to generate one.
     * <p>
     * The ideal solution is to obtain a 47 bit cryptographic quality random
     * number, and use it as the low 47 bits of the node ID, with the most
     * significant bit of the first octet of the node ID set to 1. This bit is
     * the unicast/multicast bit, which will never be set in IEEE 802 addresses
     * obtained from network cards; hence, there can never be a conflict between
     * UUIDs generated by machines with and without network cards.
     * <p>
     * If a system does not have a primitive to generate cryptographic quality
     * random numbers, then in most systems there are usually a fairly large
     * number of sources of randomness available from which one can be
     * generated. Such sources are system specific, but often include:
     * <p>- the percent of memory in use in bytes - the size of main memory in
     * bytes - the amount of free main memory in bytes - the size of the paging
     * or swap file in bytes - free bytes of paging or swap file - the total
     * size of user virtual address space in bytes - the total available user
     * address space bytes - the size of boot disk drive in bytes - the free
     * disk space on boot drive in bytes - the current time - the amount of time
     * since the system booted - the individual sizes of files in various system
     * directories - the creation, last read, and modification times of files in
     * various system directories - the utilization factors of various system
     * resources (heap, etc.) - current mouse cursor position - current caret
     * position - current number of running processes, threads - handles or IDs
     * of the desktop window and the active window - the value of stack pointer
     * of the caller - the process and thread ID of caller - various processor
     * architecture specific performance counters (instructions executed, cache
     * misses, TLB misses)
     * <p>
     * (Note that it precisely the above kinds of sources of randomness that are
     * used to seed cryptographic quality random number generators on systems
     * without special hardware for their construction.)
     * <p>
     * In addition, items such as the computer's name and the name of the
     * operating system, while not strictly speaking random, will help
     * differentiate the results from those obtained by other systems.
     * <p>
     * The exact algorithm to generate a node ID using these data is system
     * specific, because both the data available and the functions to obtain
     * them are often very system specific. However, assuming that one can
     * concatenate all the values from the randomness sources into a buffer, and
     * that a cryptographic hash function such as MD5 [3] is available, then any
     * 6 bytes of the MD5 hash of the buffer, with the multicast bit (the high
     * bit of the first byte) set will be an appropriately random node ID.
